(Secure Coding Review)

Review for Security Vulnerabilities:

•	Use of os.remove(): While os.remove() is a standard function for deleting files in Python, it does not provide a mechanism for recovering deleted files. Consider using safer methods such as moving files to a trash folder instead od permanently deleting them.

•	Error Handling: The script lack error handling, which could lead to crashes or unexpected other behavior if, for example, the specified directory does not exist or the script encounters others error during execution. Implement error handling to gracefully handle such situation and provide informative error message to the user.

•	Filesystem Permission: Depending on the operating system and user running the script, there could be issue with filesystem permission. Ensure that the script only operate within the intended directory and has appropriate permissions to read and delete files.

• Input Validation: The script takes input from the user for the directory path without validating it. This could lead to directory traversal attacks if a malicious user inputs a path containing special characters or escapes. To mitigate this, always validate and sanitize user input.
